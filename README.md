# An-Analysis-of-Kickstarter-Campaigns

An up and coming playright, Louise, wants to start a kickstarter campaign to fund her play. She has tasked us with analyzing kickstarter data to determine factors that make a kickstarter campaign successful. 

In our analysis, we have discovered multiple factors that make a campaign successful. 

The average goal of successful kickstarter campaigns is $5,048.88, with the median being $3,000.00. In terms of failed kickstarter campaigns, the average goal was $10,554.21. Given this data, we have found that the lower and more attainable the goal, the more likely a kickstarter is to succeed. 

We have also discovered that the best months to initiate a successful kickstarter campaign would be during the summer months. In the theater category, the top three successful months to start a kickstarter are May (66.87%), June (65.36%), and July (63.04%). 


Kickstarters for theater projects in the United States have a success rate of 57.57%.
