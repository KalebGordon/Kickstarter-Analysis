# An-Analysis-of-Kickstarter-Campaigns

An up and coming playright, Louise, wants to start a kickstarter campaign to fund her play. She has tasked us with analyzing kickstarter data to determine factors that make a kickstarter campaign successful. 

Kickstarters for theater projects in the United States have a success rate of 57.57%. In our analysis, we have discovered multiple factors that make this campaign more successful. 

The top three successful goal ranges in descending order are "Less than 1,000" at 75.81%, "1,000 to 4,999" at 72.61%, and "35,000 to 39,999" and "40,000 to 44,999" tied at 66.67%. 

Based on this data, the best goal range for a successful kickstarter as a play would be less than $1,000.

We have also discovered that the best months to initiate a successful kickstarter campaign would be during the summer months. In the theater category, the top three successful months to start a kickstarter are May (66.87%), June (65.36%), and July (63.04%).
